Anyway, for the main intro text use;
Maker, Creator and Inventor
My name is Jeffrey Reed and I enjoy designing and bringing ideas to life using a combination of modern tools along with traditional methods.
For the ‘read more’ button perhaps we could say ‘Services’ and have it jump below to the section with the 4 boxes from the home-3 page?
Under the services button put an about section in there?? Put something like Western New York’s premiere design and fabrication studio proudly serving WNY since 2014? Along with something like I have roughly 25 years of design and fabrication experience!
My social media button sites will be created very soon! I’ll send you links when I complete them (starting tomorrow!)
Under the about me section, maybe you can squeeze the numeric counter in there from the actual landing page and label them for like 3d prints made, items laser engraved/cut, woodworking projects competed and hundreds of satisfied customers???
Could you also link SEO metadata mentioning; wny fabrication, buffalo fabrication, buffalo 3d printing, buffalo laser engraving, buffalo woodworking, and so on as whatever you think might get me more Google and other search engine exposure.
The menu should have the items; laser engraving, 3d printing, woodworking, electronics and contact us
For the laser engraving page, you can start with the images in the images folder and I’ll get you more if needed. For the 3d printing page, electronics page can you take the images from the current TecboyLabs site under the respective pages. For the Woodworking page, can you take images from the Custom Computer section.
By the way – if you didn’t notice, the colors for TecboyLabs are red and black, but feel free to mix it up if other colors make things look better!
I don’t have a Captcha account setup yet, I’ll look into it tomorrow as well! (it’s on my list!!!)
For some reason I tried to create a logo for the home page and for the footer, but Adobe PS complained I didn’t have the HelveticaNeue Bold font installed and I couldn’t find it on Adobe site to install it??
For the electronics page can you use the Fotolia site picture #51121642 for the header background?




1)	On my tablet (or narrow desktop view) the 3 dots of upper right menu shows the email cut off? Is there a way to make it 2 lines instead of 1?
2)	Can we change the red button indicating ‘services offered’ to read ‘About Us’ and have that below the services offered boxes. (see #4 below)
3)	I noticed the favicon on my tablet is showing a brown square with a ‘P’ in it?? While the desktop has no favicon?
4)	Can we put the following text for the About Us section; (I’m sure I’ll change this but to see how it looks….)
“Tecboy Labs was established in 2014, located in Buffalo, NY as a design and fabrication studio servicing the general public.
The Tecboy Labs design and fabrication studio is not open to the public. However, tours can be provided and are by appointment only. Please contact us so we can get started with all of your design and fabrication needs.” If this sounds wrong, let me know as I’m going on 3 hours sleep!
5)	I’ve added more pictures to the images folder, you can edit them as necessary to implement in the site. Their names will dictate where to place them.
6)	Can you remove the link(s) to Twitter, as I don’t have an account and maybe down the road I’ll make one… But too much going on now! I’ll give you links to the FB, G+, and the LinkedIn as I create them this week!
7)	I think I mentioned it before, but if I forgot, can you use the Fotolia.com pic #51121642 for the Electronics section header background?
8)	For the Woodworking section can you grab the stuff from the original tecboylabs site for starters while using the woodworking-header pic for the header photo. I also uploaded more photos to the shared folder\images folder for 3d printing.



Question, I don’t see the Favicon as I look over the site, did something get messed up? (I thought it was there before?)
For the Services Offered boxes below the main header picture, I’d like Laser Engraving to have the paragraph of ‘Whether you need a unique gift idea or you need to place branding on your product, we are your one stop shop.’ For the Laser Engraving page, I’d like to use the above text at the beginning (along with the main pages photo) followed by ‘Our laser service can create a wide variety of items for you such as wedding invitations and reception items, signage made from wood or acrylic, items made from leather or denim for example. The possibilities are almost limitless.
For the second paragraph under Laser Engraving I’d like to put the materials. ‘Materials include but are not limited to; wood, acrylic, Delrin, nylon, cork, fabric, cardboard, paper, metal foils up to 0.5mm, rubber, foam (PVC free) and many more. If you don’t see your material here, simply ask us! I’ll re-examine it once this is added to see how it looks!! In-between these paragraphs, can you place some or all of the laser series photos?
For 3D Printing, please use the picture titled 3d-printing-header for the splash page banner. For the text in the services box use this ‘If you have rapid prototyping needs, or simply need a part created from your drawing, we can accommodate that.’  For the actual 3d printing section, please add the following text to the above text ‘If you have a really neat idea for the next big product or need a simple one-off item like a custom phone stand we can create that for you out of really unique types of plastics such as squishy rubbery plastic, glow-in-the-dark, or even more exotic like a wood fill type (with real wood fibers in it!) We can also accommodate your CosPlay prop item requirements. Your ideas can become reality, contact us and we’ll get started right away! In-between these paragraphs, can you place some or all of the 3d printing series photos? (if you need more, I can hook you up or you can grab them off the original site!)
For the Woodworking section please use photo titled woodworking-header for the splash page. As for the text use the following found in the Custom Computer Cases section, so we’re combining the two.
For the Electronics (I’ll ask you to revise and add more) could you take from the original site for now?
The big red ‘Services Offered’ button I think it would be better off showing ‘About Us’ and having an anchor point to the About Us section? In that section please include the following text ‘If you are in need of a unique item for a gift or you are in need of a production run of parts, we are your one stop design and fabrication studio located in Buffalo, NY and we are proudly serving all locations. So, please look around and if you have any questions, please contact us and we’ll be happy to help you.’
Since I’ve been busy printing some orders and other stuff, this delayed my getting a Facebook page going and a G+, these will be coming very soon! Thanks again!

Branding & Part Marking
PART MARKING

Tecboy Labs provides part marking services big and small and would be delighted to discuss your part number and branding needs - give us a call at 716-435-5062 or email info@tecboylabs.com.
BRANDING

If your brand is not on your product - your missing a resale opportunity. By engraving your company name, web site or part number you're helping to brand your company and products while growing your name recognition.

Laser Engraving is a permanent marking method. On bare metals a solution is applied on the metal to interact with the laser and leave a permanent black marking on the metal. When artwork from your company logos and designs is incorporated into the marking the results are impressive. Anodized Aluminum, for example, responds well and requires no marking solutions.

 
LASERABLE MATERIAL:

    Stainless Steel (marking only)
    Anodized Aluminum (marking only)
    Glass (marking only)
    Absolute Black Granite (marking only)
    Marble (marking only)
    Wood
    Acrylic
    Fabric
    Ceramic
    Denim
    Cloth

    Sorry, no PVC or vinyl records as they create toxic gasses when lasered.
